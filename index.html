		<p class="body-text">If Title 42—a pandemic-era policy that allows U.S border agents to expel migrants back to their home countries without allowing them to apply for asylum–is lifted next week by President Biden, government officials are expecting a surge of migrants crossing the border. Whether or not migrants obtain asylum depends on what state and judge hear their cases.</p>

		<p class="body-text">According to the Transactional Records Access Clearinghouse (TRAC), a data research organization at Syracuse University, 58% of U.S. asylum cases were denied this year. And, the denial of asylum rates differs from state to state, with Georgia at 92% and New York at 39%.</p>

		<p class="body-text">Various denial asylum rates across the states may be due to different political values to which judges adhere, according to Mia Unger, an immigration attorney at the Legal Aid Society for over eight years. There is a lot of room for discretion or different legal interpretations when it comes to immigration decisions, Unger added.</p>

		<p class="body-text">“Who hears your case makes a huge difference in whether or not you’ll win your case…it’s just not about the law.”</p>

		<p class="body-text">The map below, which shows the average asylum denial rates by state, is also indicative of how judges in that state could decide other immigration cases, added Unger.</p>
