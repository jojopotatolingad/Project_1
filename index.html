	<p class="body-text">August of 2022 saw the rental market in Brooklyn reach record highs, creating dire consequences in Brooklynâ€™s Community District 12, which includes Borough Park, Kensington, Sunset Park, and Midwood. </p>

	<p class="body-text">According to the Department of City Planning, about 58% of residents who live in these neighborhoods are rent burdened, which means individuals spend 35% or more of their income on rent. The community district has the second highest number of rent burdens in the city, behind only Community District 5 in the West Bronx. </p>

	<p class="body-text">The average rental price for a one bedroom apartment in Brooklyn is $3,347, an 18% increase compared to a year ago, according to the August report by real estate company Douglas Elliman. In Community District 12, the average rent is $2,047, according to Zumper, a real estate platform. </p>

	<p class="body-text">Here are four factors that are affecting tenants' ability to either pay their rent or find affordable apartment units in South Brooklyn. </p>

	<img class="icon-image" src="images/Inflation.jpeg" alt="Inflation Icon">
	<p class="icon-text">The U.S. inflation rate is about 8.2% compared to 1.7% two years ago. High inflation increases mortgage rates and deters potential homebuyers, who then are forced to remain in the rental market, which usually pushes the prices higher.</p>
